I was switching TV channels and happened to be on ZeeTV accidently.
This show was showing some guy burning restaurent of a girl to take revenge of an insult&hellip; another similar type of show was <strong>Madhubala</strong> which is  on Colors. The common thing which is happening in these shows or their  storyline is a Guy treats the girl like dirt and then they show that he is actually a nice person&hellip; and then she fall for him&hellip; these shows are too much inspired by Ishaqzaade movie.
I don&rsquo;t know about your opinion but I find it absurd.

<p>Why can&rsquo;t they create TV shows which have a good script which has good characters and shows high moral values, humane and great and fun to watch and not boring. They do show good guys in these shows but they are all boring, Why a good person has to be boring?</p>

<p>For me there is nothing good on tv, except for IPL. The only Indian TV show I like in recent time is &ldquo;Devon ke dev Mahadev&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you want my recommendation then please go ahead and watch following tv series, atleast they are interesting, have good script, exciting and will even teach you a lot about life, relationships, friendships, ethics and morality, courage etc&hellip; and they are really fun to watch :&ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li><h4>Friends</h4></li>
<li><h4>The Big Bang Theory</h4></li>
<li><h4>Game of Thrones</h4></li>
<li><h4>Dexter</h4></li>
</ul>


<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Even Disney doesn&#8217;t have any good shows for kids&#8230; I still remember shows like Duck tales, Talespin etc.'>
Sometimes I think
&ldquo;Aadhi Indian public ka dimag toh in tv shows ne kharab kar diya h&hellip;&rdquo;
and I  think Indian TV shows&#8217; quality is really deteriorating&hellip;  Even Disney doesn&rsquo;t have any good shows for kids&hellip; I still remember shows like Duck tales, Talespin etc. but now they are using too much effects and all.. but no good story. Pogo has a nice show called &ldquo;Chota Bheem&rdquo; and they telecast this show all day, So not much for kids on TV.
</span></p>

<p>Please stop watching these illogical, idiotic shows because they do impact your brain and you&rsquo;ll realize it when you&rsquo;ll finish watching all 10 seasons of Friends and after that you&rsquo;ll hate Indian TV shows&hellip; particulary those which don&rsquo;t have anything decent to show.</p>

    <id>http://www.rajrathore.com/how-i-got-this-domain</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I needed to make a matrimonial bio-data and I thought it would be convenient for me as well as for them to view my bio-data online instead of opening email everytime to view the biodata&hellip; So, I thought of setting up a small website and provide the url to them&hellip; also It allows me to make changes to it if asked for more information&hellip;</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='A domain name with your own name is a really good thing to possess.'>
I did a look up on Godaddy and&hellip; <strong>Voila!!</strong> <strong>rajrathore.com</strong> and <strong>rajrathore.me</strong> was available. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get this domain. Raj is a pretty common name in India and there are lots of Rathores&hellip; but I guess very few are programmers.. that helped.
A domain name with your own name is a really good thing to possess.
</span></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I registered the domain and took a template and filled it up with all the details and uploaded to the server, just in two hours&hellip; editing template &amp; adding information took time, everything else was snappy.</p>

<p>I never needed a bio-data, so I never set it up&hellip; and I think, I&rsquo;m never going to need one except for this one scenario&hellip;
.. I&rsquo;ll make a nice well-designed/well-crafted profile someday&hellip;</p>

<p>Bio-data is just summary of a person and I think a person&rsquo;s writing style also tells a lot about a person as well&hellip;</p>

<p>Read my blogs and know my thinking, <br/>
See my work and know my skills,<br/>
Spend time with me and know me as a human being&hellip;<br/>
Task simplified!!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m considering of writing more often and as it happens with other skills, more time you invest, better you become!</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

    <id>http://www.rajrathore.com/why-i-voted-for-narendra-modi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s election time in India and I did cast my vote on April 17 ( 3 days after my birthday ) and there are plenty who have opinion about Indian youth that &ldquo;Younger generation doesn&rsquo;t understand politics much&rdquo;</p>

<p>I may or may not understand politics much but I think that politicians&#8217; speeches and work should be considered as their examination copies.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I draw following conclusions from their speeches:</p>

<p><strong>Rahul Gandhi:</strong> Thinks that people of India are fools or atleast his target audience is less educated. That is why in his speeches he tries to teach people or more appropriately to his party men surrounding him.
I don&rsquo;t know If he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about&hellip; here is Cyrus Broacha&rsquo;s take on Rahul Gandhi&hellip;LOL!!</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='In trying to prove himself right, he proved those wrong who trusted him and voted for him'>
<strong>Arvind Kejriwal:</strong> Thinks that people of India are &ldquo;Bechari Janta&rdquo; or &ldquo;AAM or chusa hua AAM admi&rdquo;. He resigned from a great opportunity which was given to him. In trying to prove himself right, he proved those wrong who trusted him and voted for him and then he resigned on a issue. I don&rsquo;t want to tell my opinion about every idea he has in mind, everytime&hellip; that&rsquo;s his referendum bullshit&hellip; I have other things to do&hellip;  We choose/trust government to do work for us&hellip;
</span></p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='If India has to grow, India needs something similar to Silicon Valley'>
<strong>Narendra Modi:</strong> Thinks that people of india have potential to make India shine on world canvas. He thinks that people of india are smart, intelligent and not bechara. If given a chance people can achieve incredible things. He favours entreprenuership and business&hellip; If India has to grow, India needs something similar to Silicon Valley..
So far India is obsessed with jobs and govt. job psychology to the extreme level&hellip; His idea of minimum government, maximum governence is also really awesome approach..
</span></p>

is like frying a small fish.
You spoil it with too much poking. &mdash;Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching</p></blockquote>

<p>People have come up with statistics in favour or to oppose him, Oxford mathematician Peter Donnelly reveals the common mistakes humans make in interpreting statistics — and the devastating impact these errors can have on the outcome of criminal trials, watch this ted talk.</p>

<p>But people living in Gujarat electing him as CM suggest that he is somewhat more successful than others, he is a good speaker and seems active person, he gave so many speeches and traveled a lot for the campaign&hellip; if he works as PM with this much dedication &amp; positive thinking, he can do a lot.</p>

<blockquote><p>“All that we are is the result of what we have thought. The mind is everything. What we think we become.”- Buddha</p></blockquote>

<p>A positive environment and thinking is necessory for India. So, Narendra Modi became a clear choice&hellip; Now the following question arises</p>

<p><strong>Vote for local candidate or the party/PM candidate?</strong></p>

<p>I think we should vote for Party/PM candidate and not just the candidate unless the candidate is really unworthy/ criminal or corrupt, because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Area which comes under the M.P. is too large and even if the candidate says that he will do work and development etc.., He can&rsquo;t do much..yes he can do some work.
I think it&rsquo;s more of the responsibility of the State Government and local authority.</p></li>
<li><p>So the role of M.P. is to know his surrounding, have an idea about needs and problems of the people and give his opinion on the matter. That way he plays some part in policy making and voting on the bills, theoretically. But as we know MPs mostly support their party whether his individual opinion is against the bill.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Thus the real work is done by some ministers and key members of the government/party i.e. Prime Minister &amp; his team.</p>

<p>So I thought, I should vote for good government, good PM based on their stated/ unstated policies.</p>

<p>What did you think before voting and whom did you choose? and if you are going to vote.. who are you going to choose and why?</p>
