    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we bought a new air conditioner and it&rsquo;s a Hitachi Ace Reidan and We bought this model because it&rsquo;s a hot &amp; cold air conditioner and we already have a Hitachi Ace Cutout and that one performs well.</p>

<p>Buying another AC from the same company has its advantages, the remote of Ace Reidan also works with Ace cutout and that&rsquo;s a nice thing and If a service guy come to check one AC, he can check the other AC as well and that saves a trip for the service guy and that&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>There is not much difference between the price of these two air conditioners and not much difference in features as well. Hitachi Ace Reidan is a hot and cold air conditioner and will work in winters while Ace cutout takes a sleep in winters. The difference is Ace reidan reverses the cycle and provide hot air when switched to hot mode.</p>

<p>The difference in favor of ace cutout is that it has a energy star rating of 5 while Ace Reidan is still unrated probably because it&rsquo;s a new model.</p>

<p>But It seems like there is not much difference between the two ACs.
Ace Reidan with stabilizer, installation and a bit of electricity fitting, cost us around 48,500/&ndash; INR. Ace cutout costs a few thousand less.</p>

<p>Winter is coming! well it&rsquo;s now always a soothing temperature winter or summer :)</p>
