    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I needed to make a matrimonial bio-data and I thought it would be convenient for me as well as for them to view my bio-data online instead of opening email everytime to view my bio-data&hellip; So, I thought of setting up a small website and provide the url to them&hellip; also It allows me to make changes to it if asked for more information&hellip;</p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I registered the domain and took a template and filled it up with all the details and uploaded to the server, just in two hours&hellip; editing template &amp; adding information took some time, everything else was snappy.</p>

<p>I never needed a bio-data, so I never set it up&hellip; and I think, I&rsquo;m never going to need one except for this one scenario&hellip;
.. I&rsquo;ll make a nice well-designed/well-crafted profile someday&hellip;</p>

<p>Bio-data is just summary of a person and I think a person&rsquo;s writing style also tells a lot about a person as well&hellip;</p>

<p>Read my blogs and know my thinking, <br/>
See my work and know my skills,<br/>
Spend time with me and know me as a human being&hellip;<br/>
Task simplified!!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m considering of writing more often and as it happens with other skills, more time you invest, better you become!</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>
