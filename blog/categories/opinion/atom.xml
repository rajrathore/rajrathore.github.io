    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just had a look at <a href="http://mygov.nic.in" title="MyGov">MyGov</a> website, an initiative by <strong>Narendra Modi﻿</strong>. Website looks nice.. and I was surprised. Because we know how govt websites generally look like.</p>

<p>This website doesn&rsquo;t look like a govt website until you try to use it ;)
And when you try to use it, It&rsquo;s full of flaws and mistakes&hellip; this is a very polite review of the website <strong>MyGov</strong>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You can&rsquo;t signup or sign in. Webpage hangs and slow <strong>server response time</strong>(1.1 seconds), <strong>pageload speed</strong> varies from 5 sec to 60 seconds(<strong>12 seconds</strong> being average). References to the tests are given below this post.</p>

<p>Accidently when you do get successful signup, mail arrives in your spam folder.. Again a hallmark of govt websites and govt professionals. So, You can be sure that you are indeed on a govt. website.</p>

<p>This Idea of listening public opinion is nice but implementation sucks&hellip; that is my first opinion. And I am expressing this opinion on my own blog instead of expressing it on <strong>MyGov</strong> website because I couldn&rsquo;t log in.</p>

<p>It should be easy to signup/login. There is no need to be too much focused on security and doing silly things. Images are good, language used on website is nice and friendly. But Technically it sucks. Make it usable first. I think there are some more serious flaws in the code not just the optimization.</p>

<blockquote><p>“A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer.”
— Bill Gates</p></blockquote>

<p>MyGov dev team needs few such developers who challenge themselves and are exceptionally good. Most govt. professional just do what they must do and not what they should do. Ultimately they end up doing things which they shouldn&rsquo;t do. For example, what is the use of captcha when you can&rsquo;t even implement it well and user can&rsquo;t even signup. Internet connection in India is patchy, they should try to keep the webpage size under few kbs. If this website is intended to be used by public on regular basis then they should&rsquo;ve atleast optimized the website before lauching it.</p>

<p>My advice to developer team of MyGov website: Remove that captcha from signup page. It&rsquo;s very irritating. Also you are asking users to choose a password which has special characters, numbers, capital and small letters&hellip; it&rsquo;s idiotic. It gives a pseudo feeling of security and make people fake believe in security when there is none. Your website is not even using SSL. I&rsquo;m afraid that on this website users&#8217; information is not safe. Optimize your website, improve your code. And try to hire few exceptionally good programmers to do the job and not the army of incompetent programmers.</p>

<p><strong>The website is not even usable forget about security.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was switching TV channels and happened to be on ZeeTV accidently.
This show was showing some guy burning restaurent of a girl to take revenge of an insult&hellip; another similar type of show is <strong>Madhubala</strong> which is  on Colors. The common thing which is happening in these shows or their  storyline is a guy treats girl like dirt and then they show that he is actually a nice person&hellip; and then she fall for him.
I find these shows absurd.</p>

<p>Why can&rsquo;t they create TV shows which have a good scripts with good characters and high moral values, humane and fun to watch and not boring. They do show good guys in these shows but they are all boring, Why a good person has to be boring? It&rsquo;s just a pure prejudice. A person has many facet to his personality, for example &ldquo;amazing spider man&rdquo;, he is cool, interesting and does what is right, is a good hero.</p>

<p>For me there is nothing good on tv, except for IPL. The only Indian TV shows I liked in recent times are &ldquo;Devon ke dev Mahadev&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Comedy Nights with Kapil&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you want my recommendation then please go ahead and watch following tv series, atleast they are interesting, have good script, exciting and if you try to be a filter and not a sponge then these shows will even teach you a lot about life, relationships, friendships, ethics and morality, courage etc&hellip; and they are really fun to watch :-</p>

<ul>
<li><h4>Friends</h4></li>
<li><h4>The Big Bang Theory</h4></li>
<li><h4>Game of Thrones</h4></li>
<li><h4>Dexter</h4></li>
</ul>

Sometimes I think
&ldquo;Aadhi Indian public ka dimag toh in tv shows ne kharab kar diya h&hellip;&rdquo;
and I  think Indian TV shows&#8217; quality is really deteriorating&hellip;  {&ldquo;Even Disney doesn&rsquo;t have any good shows for kids&hellip; I still remember shows like Duck tales, Talespin etc. &rdquo;} but now they are using too much effects and all.. but no good story. I think Disney should rerun old shows instead of these crappy shows which they are making for kids. Pogo has a nice show called &ldquo;Chota Bheem&rdquo; and they telecast this show all day, So not much for kids on TV also.
{% endpullquote %}</p>

<p>Please stop watching these illogical, idiotic shows because they do impact your brain and you&rsquo;ll realize it when you&rsquo;ll finish watching all 10 seasons of Friends and after that you&rsquo;ll hate Indian TV shows&hellip; particulary those which don&rsquo;t have anything decent to show.</p>

    <id>http://www.rajrathore.com/why-i-voted-for-narendra-modi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s election time in India and I did cast my vote on April 17 ( 3 days after my birthday ) and there are plenty who have opinion about Indian youth that &ldquo;Younger generation doesn&rsquo;t understand politics much&rdquo;</p>

<p>I may or may not understand politics much but I think that politicians&#8217; speeches and work should be considered as their examination copies.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I draw following conclusions from their speeches:</p>

<p><strong>Rahul Gandhi:</strong> Thinks that people of India are fools or atleast his target audience is less educated. That is why in his speeches he tries to teach people or more appropriately to his party men surrounding him.
I don&rsquo;t know If he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about&hellip; here is Cyrus Broacha&rsquo;s take on Rahul Gandhi&hellip;LOL!!

<p>{% pullquote %}
<strong>Arvind Kejriwal:</strong> Thinks that people of India are &ldquo;Bechari Janta&rdquo; or &ldquo;AAM or chusa hua AAM admi&rdquo;. He resigned from a great opportunity which was given to him. {&ldquo;In trying to prove himself right, he proved those wrong who trusted him and voted for him&rdquo;} and then he resigned on a issue. I don&rsquo;t want to tell my opinion about every idea he has in mind, everytime&hellip; that&rsquo;s his referendum bullshit&hellip; I have other things to do&hellip;  We choose/trust government to do work for us&hellip;
{% endpullquote %}</p>

<p>{% pullquote %}
<strong>Narendra Modi:</strong> Thinks that people of india have potential to make India shine on world canvas. He thinks that people of india are smart, intelligent and not bechara. If given a chance people can achieve incredible things. He favours entreprenuership and business&hellip; {&ldquo;If India has to grow, India needs something similar to Silicon Valley&rdquo;}..
So far India is obsessed with jobs and govt. job psychology to the extreme level&hellip; His idea of minimum government, maximum governence is also really awesome approach..

<p>People have come up with statistics in favour or to oppose him, Oxford mathematician Peter Donnelly reveals the common mistakes humans make in interpreting statistics — and the devastating impact these errors can have on the outcome of criminal trials, watch this ted talk.</p>

<p>But people living in Gujarat electing him as CM suggest that he is somewhat more successful than others, he is a good speaker and seems active person, he gave so many speeches and traveled a lot for the campaign&hellip; if he works as PM with this much dedication &amp; positive thinking, he can do a lot.</p>

<blockquote><p>“All that we are is the result of what we have thought. The mind is everything. What we think we become.”- Buddha</p></blockquote>

<p>A positive environment and thinking is necessory for India. So, Narendra Modi became a clear choice&hellip; Now the following question arises</p>

<p><strong>Vote for local candidate or the party/PM candidate?</strong></p>

<p>I think we should vote for Party/PM candidate and not just the candidate unless the candidate is really unworthy/ criminal or corrupt, because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Area which comes under the M.P. is too large and even if the candidate says that he will do work and development etc.., He can&rsquo;t do much..yes he can do some work.
I think it&rsquo;s more of the responsibility of the State Government and local authority.</p></li>
<li><p>So the role of M.P. is to know his surrounding, have an idea about needs and problems of the people and give his opinion on the matter. That way he plays some part in policy making and voting on the bills, theoretically. But as we know MPs mostly support their party whether his individual opinion is against the bill.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Thus the real work is done by some ministers and key members of the government/party i.e. Prime Minister &amp; his team.</p>

<p>So I thought, I should vote for good government, good PM based on their stated/ unstated policies.</p>

<p>What did you think before voting and whom did you choose? and if you are going to vote.. who are you going to choose and why?</p>
