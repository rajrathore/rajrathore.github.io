  <h2><a href="/why-i-voted-for-narendra-modi/">Why I Voted for Narendra Modi?</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s election time in India and I did cast my vote on April 17 ( 3 days after my birthday ) and there are plenty who have opinion about Indian youth that &ldquo;Younger generation doesn&rsquo;t understand politics much&rdquo;</p>

<p>I may or your may not understand politics much but I think that politicians' speeches and work should be considered as their examination copies.</p>

<p>I draw following conclusions from their speeches</p>

<p><strong>Rahul Gandhi:</strong> Thinks that people of India are fools or atleast his target audience is less educated. That is why in his speeches he tries to teach people or more appropriately to his party men surrounding him.</p>

<p><strong>Arvind Kejriwal:</strong> Thinks that people of India are &ldquo;Bechari Janta&rdquo; or &ldquo;AAM or chusa hua AAM admi&rdquo;. He resigned from a great oportunity which was given to him. In trying to prove himself right, he proved those wrong who trusted him and voted for him and resigned on a issue. I don&rsquo;t want to be asked about everytime&hellip; referending bullshit&hellip; I have other things to do&hellip;  We choose/trust government to do work for us..</p>

<p><strong>Narendra Modi:</strong> Thinks that people of india have potential to make India shine on world canvas. He thinks that people of india are smart, intelligent and not bechara. If given a chance people can achieve incredible things. He favours entreprenuership and business&hellip; If India has to grow India needs a something similar to silicon valley..
So far India is obsessed with jobs and govt. job psychology to the extreme level&hellip; His idea of minimum government, maximum governence is really awesome..</p>

<blockquote><p>Governing a large country
is like frying a small fish.
You spoil it with too much poking. &mdash;Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching</p></blockquote>

<p>I happen to be a person with positive attitude, so choose Modi among these three Gentle men&hellip; So now it&rsquo;s decided that I want Modi as Prime minister of India.</p>

<p>Now the following question arises</p>

<p><strong>Should I vote for candidate or the party/PM candidate?</strong></p>

<p>I think we should vote for Party/PM candidate and not just the candidate unless the candidate is really unworthy/ criminal or corrupt, because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Area which comes under the M.P. is too large and even if the candidate says that he will do work and development etc.., He can&rsquo;t do much..yes he can do some work.
I think it&rsquo;s more of the responsibility of the State Government and local authority.</p></li>
<li><p>So the role a M.P. plays is know his surrounding and give his opinion on the matter. That way he plays some part in policy making and voting on the bills, theoretically. But as we know MPs mostly support their party whether his individual opinion is against the bill.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Thus the real work is done by some ministers and key members of the government/party that&rsquo;s Prime Minister &amp; his team.</p>

<p>So I should vote for good government, good PM based on their stated/ unstated policies.</p>

<p>What did you think before voting and whom did you choose? and if you are going to vote.. who are you going to choose and why?</p>
