        </div>
        
         
        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>How are you? In case you want to know how I am? I wanna tell you, I’ve caught cold and fever. Maybe because weather is changing.</p>

<p>And I’m writing this blog post because I don’t want you to have any wrong perception about me. I hope it&rsquo;ll clear out all the misunderstandings you or your family have about me. But I still think chats and any textual conversation can create misunderstandings than resolving it. But still it&rsquo;s better than no conversation and letting people believe false things and assumptions.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Freethinkers are those who are willing to use their minds without prejudice and without fearing to understand things that clash with their own customs, privileges, or beliefs. This state of mind is not common, but it is essential for right thinking&#8230;&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Leo Tolstoy</strong></footer></blockquote>


<h3>#1. Knocking out your family&rsquo;s doubts regarding my education</h3>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve sent you <strong>my 10th semester marksheet</strong> in my last email to your sister&rsquo;s email id, there&rsquo;s a still a slight possibility that your family keep on underestimating my education. <strong>Many of my seniors and my batch-mates and even juniors are entrepreneurs and have their own startups and are doing great</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you don’t build your dream, someone else will hire you to help them build theirs.</p><footer><strong>Dhirubhai Ambani</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>Very few students from my institute are working for some company, because most are making unique career choices. And many CCTians are doing their Doctoral Thesis in IITs. <strong>News papers and electronic media</strong> is recognizing their efforts. And many have been featured in news papers for their good work.</p>

<p>Following is the image of my senior at CCT, Sachhin Dubey giving interview to CNN-IBN. His startup is <strong>Module innovations</strong>. You can find him in my facebook-friends list, search &ldquo;Dubey&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/sachhin-dubey-cct.jpg" width="800" height="300" title="Sachhin Dubey, Module Innovations" alt="Sachin Dubey, Module Innovations"></p>

<p>So I hope you have no remaining doubts on my education.</p>

<h3>#2. Knocking out doubts about my income</h3>

<p>Since your family is unsure about my earnings, <strong>I’m including my FIRC(Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate) of my previous month’s income which my bank provided to me in this post</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/foriegn_inward_remittance.jpg" width="800" height="300" title="Dena Bank, Foreign inward remittance advice, Raj Singh Rathore" alt="Dena Bank, Foreign inward remittance advice, Raj Singh Rathore"></p>

<p><strong>It’s a receipt of USD 5743.40 i.e., 349658.00/&ndash; INR credited into my account for my last month’s earnings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Surprised! You should be. Because I&rsquo;m a future millionaire.. and will be a very successful entrepreneur and businessman. And You&rsquo;ll surely see me on TV as well.</strong></p>

<p>If someone still don’t believe then I believe it shows very high level of insecurities and distrust in people. And it’s the right time to pause and reflect on things.</p>

<h3>Probability: Your Relative(s) might be confusing you and your family</h3>

<p>I just find out that <strong>your relative(I think he is your fufosa) and my fufusa knew each other and had some sort of issue or something similar in the past</strong>, your relative wanted to marry his relative’s girl with my fufosa’s elder brother’s son. And they said no because of the height of the girl as the biy is six feet tall. I don’t know if that’s any issue. Thought I should mention.</p>

<p>When your relatives came to our house and wehn they were talking to me, I explained to them how you are a suitable partner for me and they got impressed with you. Me praising you went against me I guess. I don&rsquo;t play ego games at which many people are good at. So It&rsquo;s a possibility that your relatives got impressed with you, and might think of marrying you to their own relative&rsquo;s family. Pretty weird! Don&rsquo;t you think? One of your relative told another right there that their relative&rsquo;s son does a govt. job or something. Which suggests that they are inclined to choose a guy who does a govt. job.</p>

<p><strong>I am not a materialistic person at all, never was and never will be</strong>. I value people and care for them and don&rsquo;t hesitate to spend money to make and keep my loved ones happy.</p>

<p>I am proud of my ability, character, personality and attitude and pretty much everything that I do.</p>

<p>I am not perfect. I don&rsquo;t claim to be. But your family shouldn&rsquo;t have judged me silently and shouldn&rsquo;t have said bad things about me. Were they using <strong>some random string generation algorithm</strong> to say things. If that&rsquo;s indeed the case, I don&rsquo;t mind it. As soon as they talk to me and listen calmly and willingly that algorithm will get changed.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know something, ask me. If you don&rsquo;t agree, argue with me but please don&rsquo;t judge silently&hellip; it&rsquo;s the line that I read/heard somewhere. fits perfectly.</p>

<h3>Why am I giving importance to you?</h3>

<p>Good question. To understand that lets come to my criteria for selection for suitable life partner</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>query to find suitable bride</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">has_similar_interests_or_field_of_work</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;true&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Query Ok, Very few results returned, I think you are probably one of them.</p>

<p>[Criteria of age is there because I look younger than my age, If I marry someone of my age she’ll look older than me. Who wants to look older anyway. I look younger and it&rsquo;s a good thing.]</p>

<p>Your family is not going to find somebody like me for you, lets see the sql</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>query to find suitable groom</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Query Ok, 1 result returned(that’s me), blowing my own trumpet :) but its all true.</p>

<p>[I don&rsquo;t want dowry because I&rsquo;m intellectually and creatively capable enough to achieve what I want in life. And confident enought to be what I want to be. And fearless enough to say what I feel]</p>

<p>If you think that that the above sql query will return more results, then consider a sample size of your class at <strong>Sir MVIT</strong> and query the database based on above characteristics and you’ll find that I’m indeed right :)</p>

<p>Even if you think it is possible that there are such guys, chances of your family finding such guys are slim.</p>

<p>My teachers, family, friends and everybody else who knows me can vouch for my character. They are all proud of me.</p>

<p>Probably It&rsquo;s my mistake that I sent those emails and all that. Being an entrepreneur it&rsquo;s a very normal thing for me to send emails. I didn&rsquo;t say anything bad in that.</p>

<p>I do make mistakes and do silly things. I may even consider writing this post as silly. But then what&rsquo;s point of being too secure all the time anyway. I&rsquo;m vulnerable and I trust people easily. Who is perfect anyway.</p>

<p>This is how your family thinks:&ndash;</p>

<p> The boy sent emails and messages and now a post on his personal blog. He must be a bad boy. Or even &ldquo;Kyon piche pada hai?&rdquo;</p>

<p> These are just plain prejudices and I hate prejudices. Your relative told us that you live in bangalore and thus are very modern people. What kind modernity is this, where people form wrong opinions without knowing or understanding them. They said the boy wants to meet the girl and we don’t like it. What’s there to not like about it. I didn’t say to meet you in private or something. I only meant to talk to you in front of your family and with permission of your family. I believe marriage is a big decision… it’s a matter of sharing your life with someone. The person I’m going to share my life with, I deserve to know her. I don’t want my marriage to happen in a lucky-draw style. It&rsquo;s 21st century and 2035 is first estimate of technological singularity. But it’s also true that you know me and I don’t know you. Because I express myself freely.</p>

<p>I believe in the saying, &ldquo;if someone can&rsquo;t handle you at your worst then sure as hell they don&rsquo;t deserve you at your best&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Are you thinking about matrimonial websites then?</h3>

<p>Well, most matrimonial websites are designed for general indian public and doesn’t suite Rajput community.</p>

<p><strong>I even hacked a Rajput matrimonial website</strong> and have all the contacts downloaded on my disk. All crap. Most Fake. Contains Mostly Rajputs based out of Rajasthan. And my parents rejects them straight away.</p>

<p>If you want I can show these contacts/emails/ and their addresses and pics to you. I downloaded all content of this small website, contains both girls and boys data. It wasn’t hard to hack this website. A bit of SQL injection and I got logged in. Wrote a ruby script and downloaded all profiles and contacts.<br/>
I did this just for fun. I didn’t cause any harm to that website though. I am not mentioning the name of the website because I don’t want to get in trouble.</p>

<p>I try to keep my thinking simple. <strong>Everybody is chasing after what they find hard to get in life</strong>. I feel similar at times because I like challenges but if we both do the same thing, we’re never going to find someone worthy of us. Because <strong>It’s a paradox</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>So I gave importance to you because I thought you deserve it.</strong> I don’t like playing ego games which people play… as I said earlier I&rsquo;m very straight forward person. Too straight-forward to appear as arrogant to strangers. But those who know me like me for who I am. I&rsquo;m mostly very sweet and humble. But your family didn&rsquo;t give me any importance to me. Which I definitely deserved.</p>

<h3>Read a bit of astrology..</h3>

<p>Astrology is right sometimes and gives useful insights on broader category of kind of people</p>

<p>If you believe in astrology(I used to not believe in astrology but then started), you can read following article. I am an Aries born person and I possess all these qualities.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifestyle.allwomenstalk.com/characteristics-of-an-aries-youll-love">http://lifestyle.allwomenstalk.com/characteristics-of-an-aries-youll-love</a></p>

<p>you can read following articles about aries man and taurus woman compatibility and comments below this articles are nice as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ask-oracle.com/sign-compatibility/aries-man-taurus-woman/">http://www.ask-oracle.com/sign-compatibility/aries-man-taurus-woman/</a></p>

<p>And our Pandit Suresh Shastri told us that we are very suitable for each other. He is very well known astrologer, based in Jaipur.</p>

<h3>Why I wished you happy birthday and sent you friend request?</h3>

<p><strong>My brother told me that you sent him friend request and he accepted it and then you unfriended him?!</strong></p>

<p>So I thought, I should send you friend request. I thought may be there is something that you wanted to convey to me via my brother. I’m not sure about it though. That’s why I sent you friend request which you didn’t accept.</p>

<p>And I wished you <strong>‘Happy Birthday’</strong> on your birthday.  I thought you already have 400+ friends on Facebook and on average 25% people write on walls on birthdays, which is 100+ people in your case, one message by me won’t hurt. I believe <strong>it is a polite and good thing to wish people if you know somebody’s birthday, it makes them feel special on their special day</strong> and so I wished.</p>

<p><strong>In the End, I want to say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; to you, because of you I got the domain name for my personal blog, on which you are reading this post right now.</strong></p>

<p>I use Octopress for blogging. I hope you’ll like this blog.</p>

<p>If you liked it please let me know. It looks better on iPad. I’m happy about it because it is the only good thing that has happened to me so far because of you.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open.”</p><footer><strong>Chuck Palahniuk</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p></p>

<p><strong>If you still think that I am a bad guy, can you do the following task:</strong>
Join your hands, close your eyes and pray to God, &ldquo;God, I don&rsquo;t like this guy(Raj), and may I marry a guy who is opposite of him in nature, character, personality, attitude, honesty, creativity and goodness&rdquo; :)</p>

<p>And please don&rsquo;t think like, &ldquo;Yeh ladka toh picche hi pad gaya&rdquo; because then I&rsquo;ll think that your brain is spoiled by MTV. And I hope you are not. I don&rsquo;t like MTV. And especially roadies. I like adventure and everything but not the show, not anymore. It&rsquo;s fun but can&rsquo;t teach anything worth learning.</p>

<p>If you still find anything hurtful in any manner in this post. I humbly apologise.</p>

<p>And Definitely you won&rsquo;t find someone who can write this long a post to clarify things.</p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll find this post, which is even longer than the assays I wrote in exams :), as intellectual, pragmatic and sincere. Because that&rsquo;s the way I meant it to be.</p>

<p>And please don&rsquo;t look for gramatical mistakes in this post. And I hope you tried to be a filter and not a sponge while reading it. If you try to find good things, you&rsquo;ll find good and if you look doubtful and look for bad then you&rsquo;ll bad things where none exists and may label good as bad. But I hope you are intelligent person. And you&rsquo;ll be able to put things in right perspective.</p>

<p>And if it indeed was your decision to reject me in the first place and not your family&rsquo;s, then take responsibility of your decisions. If your family had told us that &ldquo;our daughter thinks that he&rsquo;s not suitable for her&rdquo; then it wouldn&rsquo;t have been hurtful to me at all. How you feel is how you feel and it&rsquo;s perfectly fine.</p>
